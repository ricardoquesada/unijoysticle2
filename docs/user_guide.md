## Supported computers

![supported computers](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j9KjfEW5KXse1Caf0xV8WfD8c7HRFO1UCHx5WOnPMAneoKOPsDs8UNXAFS84D9pXzcu5ZdHoPxJDdqNvzUB_0q7hk7tQcqxYXQIa7NsLZ3j-KLlG-qyFI6TknNgiYNpwcIdXxEROOhI=-no)

The Unijoysticle 2 was designed to fit in the Commodore 64, and Amiga 500 computers. No additional
cables are needed for these computers.

However, the Unijoysticle 2 can be used in any computer that is compatible with the Atari DB9 joystick ports.

That includes, but not limited to:

- Commodore 64 / SX-64 / 128 / 128-D.
- Atari 8-bit line, both computers and consoles (requires [DB9 extension cable][cable]).
- Amiga line (Unijoysticle2 / 2+ requires [DB9 extension cable][cable], Unijoysticle 2 A500 fits Ok).
- Atari ST line (requires [DB9 extension cable][cable]).
- Commodore 16 / 116 / +4 (requires adapter)
- [Vampire v4 Stand Alone][vampirev4] (tested by the community)
- [A2560 Foenix][a2560] (tested by the community)

## Flashing the firmware

See: [firmware_setup.md][firmware_setup]

[firmware_setup]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/blob/main/docs/firmware_setup.md

## How to power on the device

There are multiple ways to power on the device

|   | v2 | v2+ | A500 | C64 |
| - | -- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Self-powered | Yes, requires the "Self powered" switch to be On | Yes, always On | Yes, always On | Yes, always On |
| USB powered | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| External 5V+ | Yes, using the Barrel jack | No | No | No |

Note: It is safe to plug the two / three of them at the same time, but that won't give you any additional benefit.

### Self-powered

| v2 | v2+ | A500 | C64 |
| -- | --- | ---- | --- |
| ![uni2_self_powered_photo] | ![uni2plus_self_powered_photo] | ![uni_a500_self_powered_photo] | ![uni_c64_self_powered_photo] |

- Gets current directly from the joystick ports. No extra cables needed.
- [v2 only] "Self-powered" switch must be "ON", otherwise the ESP32 won't receive current.
- A beefy [power supply with ~4Amps][power_supply] is recommended (depends on the peripherals used).
- Tested successfully with:
  - C128 + 1541 Ultimate 2 + Unijoysticle 2 + [beefy power supply][power_supply].
  - C64 + 1541 Ultimate 2 + Unijoysticle 2 + [beefy power supply][power_supply].
  - SX-64 + Unijoysticle 2
  - Atari ST 1040F + Unijoysticle 2
  - Amiga 1200 + Unijoysticle 2 A500

Note: The Amiga 500 doesn't provide enough current to power the Unijoysticle.
You should power the Unijoysticle through the USB port.
It is possible to connect the USB port to the Amiga Disk Drive connector
(Pin 12 = +5V / Pin 3 = GND, see [How to build your own Amiga USB power cable][disk_drive_power]) which provides enough current.

Self-power is available since Unijoysticle 2 [Revision D][changelog_board], and is present in all
Unijoysticle 2+ / Unijoysticle 2 A500 revisions.

## Using Gamepads

The first gamepad to connect will control joystick #2 (Red LED).
The second gamepad to connect will use the available joystick.

If you want to control joystick #1 (Green LED), and you only have one gamepad connected,
you have to press the "swap" button in the gamepad.

![swap joystick](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWuZ8_hwMcuU8fjTmPog8Qb0jhrimzSPN-7gOnx_LNW4phrxEWe6Y8cLr7kRVzsPqxjSg7w2QY3n2kYhLT7Q75cJShM8Vihy239hccfkEo40Jp2b4t5H-468QrBRA8xAuntwyG5b5LjbyRSve7VCrx-Rw=h320-no)

The "swap" button varies from gamepad to gamepad, but usually it is mapped to
the big button in the center. E.g: In the Xbox One it is the "Xbox" button; for PlayStation gamepads, it is the "PS" button.

If two gamepads are connected, then both controllers must press the "swap" button in order to swap joysticks.

Note: [A500 only] Unijoysticle 2 A500 has a built-in "swap" button. Press it to swap joystick ports.

The gamepad could be in three possible modes:

- Basic mode: one gamepad controls one joystick.
- Enhanced mode: one gamepad controls the two joysticks.
- [A500 only] Mouse mode: one gamepad controls one mouse.

### Basic mode

![basic mode](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLW09v8uSrCzB-2ooXXoH-leP2SPqV0-vg6Ym_IFNjwlpQoVELZQguo9oVIl3WhdzG2N-RQTyjH0xV8amFrCSv1XYpcUmgdRKJwGePIeBYQoUtx8JzbZS_c1L3nC3nRmTWdwSolBOnELwMal9qSkSpzfVw=h330-no)

*Basic mode* is what you would expect, with the additional benefit that
Button B is mapped to "jump". Ideal for platform games like Giana Sisters,
Super Mario Bros, Mayhem in Monsterland, etc.

- D-pad/joypad: controls up/down/left/right
- Button A / Cross: fire button
- Button B / Circle: "up"  (ideal for platform games)
- Button X / Square: 2nd button (Amiga / Atari ST only)
- Button Y / Triangle: 3nd button (Amiga / Atari ST only)
- Button shoulder-right: autofire

### Enhanced mode (AKA Dual Stick mode)

![enhanced mode](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUC6pvyoJ5v5Zb4HNQwBlbUCCKL5IPrZnrTz9S9P-Pkw1AoWjl48LQBmVagog591bUTDwPFaQorr_J9UtaWRldUpNClSc5ZZvX3DfNI5YQKOOwSIawdGMCHQeYWu-ne6RW_BdvlK10seuz1kvvnElMxaw=h360-no)

In *Enhanced mode*, you control both joysticks from only one gamepad.
Since "Button B" is mapped to "J1 fire" this is great for games like
[Commando][commando] or [1942][1942] since you can throw grenades / do rolls with it.
It also opens up the possibility to create games that require more controls,
like [Commando 2084][commando2084]

- Left joypad / d-pad: control Joystick #2 movements
- Right joypad: control Joystick #1 movements
- Button A / Cross: fire for Joystick #2
- Button B / Circle: fire for Joystick #1
- Button X / Square: 2nd button for Joystick #2
- Button Y / Triangle: 2nd button for Joystick #1
- Button Shoulder Left: auto-fire for Joystick #2
- Button Shoulder Right: auto-fire for Joystick #1

[1942]: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=38140
[commando]: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=137173
[commando2084]: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=182074

### Mouse mode

![mouse mode](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVubfn8u70c-UnHu_3M0BmpYhGw9jdHpyHt2whhCqM-LAUWz6JK3I7nSJvrLgdsmH-EYmSKYtQgERpH77DbhAIb66fDPVbTVY_a-xvaNoOGcYenJVmFQKdcS5TnODlVK1QpfL0HFOlzXbHVRNjVz39vDA=h320-no)

[A500 only]

In *Mouse mode* you control the mouse from a gamepad.

- Left or Right axis control the cursor movement
- Button A / Cross: left button
- Button B / Circle: right button
- Button X / Square: middle button

Note: Mouse emulation only works on Atari ST / Amiga computers.

### How to use it

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/506468.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/506468)

As an example, this is how to connect to the console using `tio` and `minicom`

```sh
# tio: A great serial terminal  (recommended!)
$ tio /dev/ttyUSB0

# If you can't use tio, minicom works too.
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

There are many useful commands. The most "common" ones are:

* `list_devices`:  Get information about connected devices
* `get_mouse_scale`:  Get global mouse scale factor
* `set_mouse_scale  <value>`: Set global mouse scale factor
* `set_bluetooth_enabled  <0 | 1>`: To enable/disable Bluetooth discovery mode
* `swap_ports`: Swaps joystick ports
* `set_gamepad_mode  <mode>`: 'normal', 'enhanced' or 'mouse'
* `get_gamepad_mode`: Returns the gamepad mode.
* `set_mouse_emulation  <emulation>`: 'amiga', 'atarist'
* `get_mouse_emulation`: Returns mouse emulation mode
* `set_autofire_cps  <cps>` Sets the autofire 'clicks per second' (cps)
* `get_autofire_cps`: Returns the autofire 'clicks per second' (cps)
* `version` Gets the Unijoysticle version info
* `help`: Print the list of registered commands

## Troubleshooting

### Fails to boot

![booting](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWhqgMB9Ysm8rpigW8leZ-9EVDI6V16cgqHZ367sgmLW5_ryNepZgCgczJwPRkreb9YBnEFCRXXY3mhwJk7wLR-vo2qRNmtjzNkC-4nnxtCKecsL4qI7CnLm1owSAOWeCwqHjyA9TxdaLE10FzuXWQLWg=-no)

Booting the device takes ~1 second. You should see:

- Power LED must be On
- J1 (Green) & J2 (Red) LEDs should stay On for ~1 second
- Once J1 and J2 are Off, the device will be ready to use

If one of the above mentioned conditions are not met, please file a bug (See "Filing bugs" down below).

### Gamepad cannot connect

This could be due to a lot of things. Assuming that you are using a [supported gamepad][supported_gamepads], try:

1. Unplug the Unijoysticle from the Commodore (turn off the Commodore first).

2. Reset the Unijoysticle: Press the "Reset" button that is placed in the ESP32 Mini Kit.

3. While rebooting, the LEDs should turn on, and after ~half a second, then they should turn off.
   - If the LEDs don't turn On at all: file a bug (see below).
   - If the LEDs don't turn Off, it means that Bluetooth is not ready. Go to step 2.

4. Once the LEDs are off, trying connecting the Gamepad again.

5. If it fails press "Reset + Toggle-Mode" buttons at the same time.
   This will reboot the Unijoysticle while also deleting the stored Bluetooth keys.

6. Put the gamepad in Bluetooth discovery mode (grab the manual of your gamepad). Try again.

7. If it fails, trying connecting the gamepad to a Linux (MacOs or Windows might be the same) machine first.
   If the gamepad cannot connect to Linux, then most probably it is a gamepad issue. Cannot help here.

8. Repeat. Go to Step 2.

If it keeps failing, file a bug (see below).

[supported_gamepads]: supported_gamepads.md

### Gamepad cannot re-connect

Assuming that the gamepad connects Ok for the first time, but fails to reconnect then:

- Press the Reset + Toggle-Mode buttons at the same time.
  This will reboot the Unijoysticle while also deleting the stored BT keys.
  Any try again.

- Put the gamepad in Bluetooth discovery mode. And try again.

If none of the above works, file a bug (see below).

## Filing bugs

File bug here: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2/issues

When you file a bug, make sure that you include as much information as possible:

- Gamepad you are using. If possible the firmware version the gamepad is using.
- Unijoysticle firmware.
- Computer that you are using: C64, C128, etc.
- How you are powering the Unijoysticle.
- Logs (this is the most important thing!)

### Unijoysticle logs

The logs can be fetched by connecting a terminal to the ESP32 module.

1. Connect the ESP32 module to your PC using a micro USB cable.
2. Launch any serial terminal. Possible options:
   * Arduino Serial Terminal (See below for detailed steps)
   * or `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux, macOS)
   * or `tio /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux, macOS)
   * or `idf.py monitor` (Linux, macOS, Windows. requires to checkout Bluepad32 source code)
3. Reset the Unijoysticle
4. Try to connect the gamepad again.
5. Let it try for a few seconds.
6. Copy & paste the output from the terminal and put it in the bug report.
